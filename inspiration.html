            From the artist, Vicki F:
            <blockquote>
                I am the daughter of a construction engineer. We traveled all over the state for him to do his job. I would sit in the
                backseat of our car and watch the golden grasses on the hills of California. I would always want to stop and run up the
                hill so that I could run my hands over the golden grasses. My father’s jobs took us out of state and eventually
                overseas. Every time we returned to my home in Merced, California, I would be so grateful to see my home state again.
                There really is nothing like it in the rest of the world. As I grew older, my appreciation deepened and my education
                grew, knowing the qualities and frailties in my state.

            From “Lands of Promise and Despair; Chronicles of Early California, 1535-1846”, edited by Rosemarie Beebe and Robert
            M. Senkewicz:
            <blockquote>
                The name “California” first appeared in a work published in Seville in the 1510 by Garci Rodrígues de Montalvo entitled
                The Labors of the Very Brave Knight Esplandian. Rodríguez de Montalvo was born in the middle of the fifteenth century.
                He participated in the final phases of the reconquista and was knighted for his service at Alhama de Granada in 1482. By
                the 1490’s, he was hard at work on his five-volume set, Amadis de Gaula, one of the first of many published books of
                fiction on the themes of chivalry and courtly love which so captivated the Spanish-reading public during the age of
                exploration and conquest. The first four volumes represented Rodríguez de Montalvo’s re-working of oral legends that
                were centuries old. The fifth volume, whose composition was begun in the 1490s and which was partly influenced by the
                tales brought back to Spain by Columbus and the early explorers, was Rodríguez de Montalvo’s own creation. It concerned
                the adventures of Esplandián, the son of Amadis. The passage reproduced below is taken from chapter 157 of the book.
                <br/><br/>
                At this point in the novel, the “pagans” (i.e. Moslems) are attacking the Christian city of Constantinople. Word of this
                reaches even to the fictional island of California in the Indies. It is inhabited only by women and ruled by a queen
                named Calafia. She convinces her women to join the pagan alliance and they sail to Constantinople. Their fabled
                griffins, creatures with the heads and wings of eagles but the bodies of lions, proved to be especially formidable
                fighters and capture and kill many Christian defenders of the city. But the griffins are unable to distinguish between
                Christian and pagan males, and soon take to killing Calafia’s allies as well. Accordingly, she has to remove them from
                the battle. Instead, she and the male warrior, Radiaro, challenge Amadís and his son Esplandián, who is called “the
                Knight of the Great Serpent,” to combat. When she visits Constantinople to confirm the challenge, she sees Esplandián
                and is smitten with love for him. During the combat, Esplandián defeats Radiaro, and Amadis beats Calafia, who is taken
                prisoner. During the final battle for the city, she sends a message to her women not to participate in the battle, and
                the pagans are routed. Esplandián marries the daughter of the emperor, who then abdicates so that Esplandián and his new
                wife can rule. Calafia becomes a Christian and marries Esplandián’s cousin, Talanque. The two of them return to
                California, where Rodríguez de Montalvo says “they underwent many amazing adventures, including very large challenges,
                many battles and victories over great seigniories, but we decline to say more about what became of them because, if we
                wished to do so, it would be a never-ending story.”
                <br/><br/>
                The names Califa and California were rooted in the Arabic word khalifa, which enters English as “caliph.” The use of the
                word is clearly meant to call to mind the reconquista. In the novel, California is consistently associated with gold and
                wealth. Queen Calafia and her women left the sea to enter the battle “wearing their golden armor that was studded all
                over with precious stones which were found on California Island as abundantly as rocks in a field.” In her challenge to
                Amadís and Esplandián, Calafia identified herself as “the very courageous ruler of California Island, where an amazing
                abundance of gold and precious stones are found.” When Calafia went to meet Esplandián to formalize the challenge, her
                robes “were made entirely of gold and many precious stones.” Also, she wore a “finely designed headdress with a huge
                volume of twists and turns, and when she finally put it on her head, it was like a capeline: it was made completely of
                gold and studded with gems of great value.” In this work of fiction, “California” is associated with wealth, conquest,
                indigenous people who are willing to convert to Christianity, and indigenous women willing to give themselves to
                European men.
                <br/><br/>
                Esplandian was a very popular work, a quintessential chivalric novel. After its publication in 1510 it went through at
                least ten more Spanish editions and was translated into French, Italian, German, and English in the sixteenth century.
                Hernán Cortés is known to have read it. Towards the beginning of Cervantes’s Don Quixote (1605), two of Quixote’s
                neighbors, a priest and a barber, became convinced that Quixote’s eccentric behaviour stems from his having read too
                many of these sorts of novels, so they go through his library, determined to burn the offending works. The first book
                they select for their bonfire is none other than Esplandián. But by that time, “California” had evolved from an imagined
            to a real place.
